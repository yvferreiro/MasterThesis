# Masters-Thesis

This is the code repository for Danielle and Yolanda's 2023 Master's Thesis for their Machine Learning Degree. The code is here for validation of methodology and models and the original dataset can be provided upon request. 

This thesis explores online news articles from the BBC from 2010 to 2022. It uses a BiLSTM-RNN and logistic regression as a classifier for full text data. The objective is to classify real-text sentences as male/female and use the coefficients to assess language choices around men and women.

See Thesis.pdf for the full paper describing the methods. 

Note: There are word lists that appear in this repository that come from the research of others. All lexicons and corpera are fully cited in the thesis document.
